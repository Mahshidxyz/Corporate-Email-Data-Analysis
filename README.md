# Capstone Project 1: Exploring the Enron Email Dataset  
My first capstone project at the Springboard bootcamp  

### Summary
In this project I analyzed the emailing trends and habits at the Enron corporation, made statistical inferences and found correlations, presented network graphs, and built classifiers that can be used for labeling emails. For the classifiers, I used the bag of words model with the multinomial naive bayes and logistic regression machine learning algorithms.

### Data
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/zichen/explore-enron/data  
Size:  1.3 GB  
The data contains more than 500,000 emails, retrieved from the user folders of 150 Enron employees.  
The corpus is the largest publicly available mass collections of real emails which is not bounded by privacy and legal restrictions.

### Workflow

### Background about Enron and the dataset
Enron was an American energy, commodities, and services company based in Houston, Texas. It was founded in 1985 and filed for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. Enron had approximately 20,000 employees with claimed revenues of ~$101 billion in 2000. Fortune named Enron *America's Most Innovative Company* for six consecutive years. At the end of 2001, it was revealed that Enron’s reported financial condition was sustained by institutionalized accounting fraud known as the Enron Scandal. The email data was originally made public by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation. Andrew McCallum, a computer scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, purchased a copy of the email database for $10,000 and released it to researchers.
